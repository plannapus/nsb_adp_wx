Version 0.1 (14/02/2017):
	- Port of Pat Diver's nsb_adp.py to wxPython. A large amount of code needed to be modified to fit wx (including many scope issue).
	- Corrected bug which happened on some sites and prevented the plot from being drawn (caused by `color ='none'`).
	- Modified functionalities: most saving and inspecting options and help files are now also available from a menubar; parameters are now entered thanks to radio buttons rather than 0/1 fields; DB connexion parameters simplified; added a message-board so that messages do not appear only in the console in the middle of stderr.
