Version 0.3:
	- Corrected unicode issue (that Pat already corrected, mea culpa)
	- Added possibility to add or remove a grid.
	- Simplified/Harmonized code.

Version 0.2 (28/02/2017):
	- Added possibility to load new stratigraphic events or a new LOC from file even if working with database data.
	- User can now save biostratigraphic data to a file, in the Inspect Biostratigraphic Events dialog window.
	- Got rid of some minor annoyances such as the sofware not accepting input files with extra new lines at the end of the file; got rid of hardcoded 'toScale' variable in some functions; wrote a function `replot` to avoid duplicated code.

Version 0.1 (14/02/2017):
	- Port of Pat Diver's nsb_adp.py to wxPython. A large amount of code needed to be modified to fit wx (including many scope issue).
	- Corrected bug which happened on some sites and prevented the plot from being drawn (caused by `color ='none'`).
	- Modified functionalities: most saving and inspecting options and help files are now also available from a menubar; parameters are now entered thanks to radio buttons rather than 0/1 fields; DB connexion parameters simplified; added a message-board so that messages do not appear only in the console in the middle of stderr.
