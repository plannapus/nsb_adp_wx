Version 0.7.1:
	- Corrected plot_paleomag_interval bug.

Version 0.7 (19/09/2019):
	- Created user manual and linked to it from inside the app.

Version 0.6.1 (01/12/2017):
	- Corrected bug with None type and "Export to file".

Version 0.6 (09/09/2017):
	- User can now compare visually two LOCs.
	- Created a LOC manager where the user can set the current LOC or delete a loaded LOC.
	- Users can now add a new LOC from the database as well as from a file (therefore users can see the differences between various revisions).
	- Simplified 'Welcome' window.
	- Brought back Pat's code that allowed to go back to a previous LOC. On top of it, it now correctly shows the name of the LOC in the metadata when switching from one to another.

Version 0.5 (06/09/2017):
	- Modified (and simplified) the database query to retrieve events: now even events for which we do not have a calibration are retrieved (thus allowing the user to project them on the LOC and estimate their age).
	- Corrected the bug happening with List Biostratigraphic events when no age conversion was done (hence no "original age" was set).
	- Corrected the tiny bug preventing to project the events on the LOC.
	- Data of unknown age are no longer projected at age 9999Ma but their age is really set to None. This required a few modifications from the code (fix_null for instance) but also from the SQL queries.
	- Corrected weird bug happening when an event in neptune_event has sample_top but no top_sample_depth and its core didn't exist in neptune_core (!) thus generating a None value that needs to be caught for depth as well.
	- Modified handling of plot codes in user provided strat files: if the plot code is not recognized as a top (starts with T), bottom (starts with B) or a zone (starts with Z), it does not return an error anymore but plot the datum in filled color, with no indication of its type.
	- Modified hit-box size for clicking on a point: xtol is now fixed at 0.1 Myr and ytol at 1.5m (i. e. one section). Used to be range of data/(nb of data points * 4) which was a problem in crowded plots.
	- Corrected bug with range boxes introduced when changing depth polarity.
	- Plotting markers and colors are now customizable using a plot_config.txt file. The type of biostratigraphic datums recognized by the software is therefore also extendable ad infinitum.
	- Got rid of matplotlib navigation toolbar (was redundant with already programmed functionalities).
	- Added possibility to save the plot in PDF, TIFF and SVG formats.
	- Added modification for compatibility with matplotlib 2.0
	- Continued simplification and pythonization of code:
		- introduced use of ternary operator and list comprehensions when needed instead of for-loops and nested if-statements.
		- defined variables used several times instead of recalculating / got rid of some single-use variables.

Version 0.4 (07/06/2017):
	- Corrected axis dialog faulty behavior.
 	- Made function 'Run' terminate correctly even in case of cancellation by user.
	- Made tick marks more visible.
	- Added revision_no on metadata.
	- Added possibility to choose on which age model present in the database for a given hole to work on, the default revision_no is the one that has a current_flag == 'Y'.
	- Enabled again the toggling of the LOC line.
	- Modified aesthetic of the hole list.
	- Modified SQL query linked to the hole list in order to provide additional info (number of events, presence of an age model).
	- Function `read_loc` and `read_datum` now catch error in the header line of the files, or if a value is not numerical.
	- Now discards cores with letters in their names.
	- Don't ask if LOC needs to be plotted anymore: if db, plot systematically if there is one; if file, plot it only if file is provided.
	- Stop spamming user with hiatus alert.
	- Continued simplification of code:
		- got rid of all get_minmax_* functions.
		- code now serves all help frames from a single function.
		- removed most aliasing of 'data' objects.

Version 0.3 (02/05/2017):
	- Corrected unicode issue (that Pat already corrected, mea culpa)
	- Simplified/Harmonized code:
		- one-lined broken lines.
		- pythonified `if` calls (i. e. removed brackets and replaced ampersand with 'and').
		- replaced many 'self' with their direct 'data' counterpart.
		- removed redundant code and some single-usage wrappers.
		- replaced multiple calls to rcParams['keymap....'] to a single plt.rc('keymap',...).
	- Corrected polarity of depth (depth is positive).
	- Added minor ticks and made ticks exterior to the plot.
	- Added possibility to toggle a grid.
	- Added Pat's latest additions (such as plot_metadata).

Version 0.2 (28/02/2017):
	- Added possibility to load new stratigraphic events or a new LOC from file even if working with database data.
	- User can now save biostratigraphic data to a file, in the Inspect Biostratigraphic Events dialog window.
	- Got rid of some minor annoyances such as the software not accepting input files with extra new lines at the end of the file.
 	- Got rid of hardcoded 'toScale' variable in some functions.
	- Wrote a function `replot` to avoid duplicated code.

Version 0.1 (14/02/2017):
	- Port of Pat Diver's nsb_adp.py to wxPython: a large amount of code needed to be modified to fit wx (many scope issues).
	- Corrected bug which happened on some sites and prevented the plot from being drawn (caused by `color ='none'`).
	- Modified functionalities:
		- most saving and inspecting options and help files are now also available from a menubar.
		- parameters are now entered thanks to radio buttons rather than 0/1 fields.
		- DB connexion parameters simplified.
		- added a message-board so that messages do not appear only in the console in the middle of stderr.
