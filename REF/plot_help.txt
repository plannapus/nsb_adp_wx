--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  These are the Key-bindings when interacting with the Age-Depth Plot:

      LOC
      't' toggle line off/on
      'i' insert a vertex
      'd' delete a vertex
      ... move a vertex (no key binding)
      's' save LOC to file
      'p' save the Plot to a file

      DATA
      'l' list data
      'c' project events on LOC

      PLOT
      'a' axes definition
      'e' edit title, axes labels
      'g' toggle grid on major ticks

      HELP
      'h' plot help
      'H' program help

      EXIT
      'x' Exit

--- LOC ---

't':  Toggle the Line of Correlation (LOC) on/off

'i':  To insert a new vertex (point) to create a line segment place your cursor at the
      x,y location where you want to insert and press 'i' on your keyboard.  The program
      will detect if the position is valid and if so will add the point and redraw the
      line.

'd':  To delete a vertex (and line segment), place your cursor over the vertex and press
      'd' on your keyboard.  The program will remove the point and redraw the line.

...:  To move a vertex (no key-binding) simply click your left mouse with the cursor over
      a point, drag it to a new location and release the mouse button.  The program will
      limit the placement of the point to a valid region bounded by the next higher/younger
      and next lower/older vertices.

's':  To save the currently displayed LOC, press 's' on your keyboard when your cursor
      is within the bounds of the plot axes.  A dialog will prompt you for a filename
      to save the data.  The default name is the name of the hole with "_loc.txt" appended
      to it, and the default directory is your $NSBPATH/LOC/ .

--- DATA ---

'l':  To list the events being displayed, press 'l' on your keyboard when your cursor is
      within the bounds of the plot axes.  A display window will appear and show a tab-delimited
      listing of the event data.  A copy/paste of the data into file will save the data which
      can be imported and viewed in a spreadsheet application such as MS Excel or OpenOffice.

'c':  To "project" the event data to the LOC, press 'p' on your keyboard when your cursor is
      within the bounds of the plot axes.  The program will calculate the "projected age" of each
      event - the age of the event projected to the LOC.  A dialog will prompt you for a filename
      to save the data.  The default name is the name of the hole with "_proj.txt" appended to it,
      and the default directory is PROJ/ .  The listing will contain the original event
      "plot_age", the "proj_age", and the "proj_extension_age" which shows the difference between
      the plot_age and proj_age.  The file is tab-delimited and may be imported to a spreadsheet
      program such as MS Excel or OpenOffice.

--- PLOT ---

'a':  To re-define the axes limits for the plot, press 'a' on your keyboard.  A dialog will appear
      with the default axes values for xMin, xMax, yMin, and yMax.  You can change any or all of these
      and click "OK" or presss "Enter/Return" on your keyboard.  The plot will redraw with the new
      axes definition.  Select the Cancel button to return to the plot without making changes.

'e':  To edit the title and/or the axes labels, press 'e' on your keyboard.  A dialog will appear
      with the default title and axes label values.  You can change any or all of these and select "OK"
      or press "Enter/Return" on your keyboard.  The plot will redraw with the new title and axes labels.
      Select the Cancel button to return to the plot without making changes.

'g':  To add or remove a grid to the plot, press 'g' on your keyboard.

--- HELP ---

'h':  Plot help (this) - file REF/plot_help.txt is read and displayed in a window.  To close,
      select the OK button or simply hit the Enter/Return button on your keyboard.

'H':  Program help - file REF/program_help.txt is read and displayed in a window.  To close,
      select the OK button or simply hit the Enter/Return button on your keyboard.

--- EXIT ---
'x':  Exit (close) the plot and exit the program

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.  Annotating / Identifying events:

To display information on a particular event (point/symbol) you have three options:

    1. click Left Mouse (Button 1)   : to show the plot_code :  tDNITZdent
    2. click Middle Mouse (Button 2) : to show the plot_code, age, and depth : tDNITZdent (11.836, -69.290)
    3. click Right Mouse (Button 3)  : to show the plot_code, event_name, age, and depth : tDNITZdent:Nitschia denticulata (11.836, -69.290)

    Example Notes:  plot_code (when querying database) consists of:
            event_type (lower_case): t
            fossil_group (usually one letter upper case): D
            genus of event_name (abbreviated upper case): NITZ
            species of event_name (abbreviated lower case): dent

If any of the buttons are clicked again for the same point the annotation will turn off.

The first time you click on a point with a mouse button, the information will appear in the "quadrant" where
you clicked near the point.  You can use this to spread out annotation to minimize overposting of closely-spaced
events:

Quadrant 1:  above/right of point :  vertical/bottom, horizontal/left  justification
Quadrant 2:  below/right of point :  vertical/top,    horizontal/left  justification
Quadrant 3:  below/left of point  :  vertical/top,    horizontal/right justification
Quadrant 4:  above/left of point  :  vertical/bottom, horizontal/right justification

If more than one point very close to the same x,y location clicked the program will attempt to place the annotation
for them offset to the right and left no matter the quadrant selected.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.  Legend

The data points are grouped and plotted according to fossil group and event type such as "D:T" for "Diatoms:TOP"
or "N:B" for "Nannoplankton:BOT" (BOT = BASE).  If you click a symbol for a particular group:type all the events
that are a member of that group are visibly turned off, and the legend text color is turned to red from black.
If you click on the same symbol again, the events are visibly turned back on and the legend text color is changed
back to black.  One or more groups can be turned off to unclutter the view of the plot to review a particular
group:type for instance when working with a line of correlation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.  Configuring the plot

The type of stratigraphic events that the software can recognize and their associated color and marker symbol on
the plot can be configured by the user by modifying the file /REF/plot_config.txt. This file is a tab-separated
matrix associating the code for a stratigraphic group, its name, its marker symbol and its color.
By default the file is the following:

fossil_group	name	symbol	color
F	Foraminifera	^	red
N	Nannofossils	D	green
R	Radiolarians	d	darkblue
D	Diatoms	8	#93B0CF
M	Magnetic reversal	s	black
DN	Dinoflagellates	o	magenta
I	Isotopes	+	grey

Colors are any colors recognized by python's matplotlib, i. e. can be in natural language or in RGB code preceded by a #.
The complete list of possible marker symbols can be found at the following URL: http://matplotlib.org/api/markers_api.html
