# nsb_adp_wx

Fork of Pat Diver's NSB_ADP.py in which the software uses wxPython framework (instead of easygui) in order to allow a fancier GUI interface.

Main functionalities seem to work so far.  
Still need testing and major clean-up (including style harmonization).

File CORE.zip contains most CORE files for DSDP and ODP holes.
